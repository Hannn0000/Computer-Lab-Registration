# Computer-Lab-Registration
This is a computer lab registration system using 8051 microcontroller. 
## Flow of the system
After connecting the hardware to power source, the system is switched on. The LCD, both green and red LEDs, and the seven-segment display are all in sleep mode. When the IR sensor detects people approaching the keypad, which means there are people standing in front of the registration system, the LCD will display welcoming message. Then, it will show a message to ask user for choosing their identity, which is either staff or student. After choosing the user’s identity, user is asked to enter his staff id or matric number based on the identity he chose in the previous step. If the user entered valid id or matric number, the LCD will then be displaying valid message. At the same time, the seven-segment display will show letter ‘P’ which means pass and the green LED will light up. After a second, the I/O devices will go to sleep mode and wait for the next detection from IR sensor. In contrast, if the user enters the invalid id or matric number, the LCD will display invalid message. The seven-segment display will show letter ‘F’ which indicates fail and the red LED will light up. Then, the system will return to the stage where it asks for the user’s identity.
